flickering when teleporting
teleporting into moving objects that hve moved within 1 screen width
objects should wrap around
nest sometimes moves out the top of the map
flock is not seperating correctly
better way to do leftTextue andr ightTexutre (culling)
only half of ai visible at wrap around points
instead of passing actual vector ref to nests etc, pass ref to a manager which will do it for you
why is it so laggy
abductor patrol only use max speed correctly on x axis
